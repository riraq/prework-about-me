      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Rony, I am excited to go through this Boot Camp to pivot my career and explore the exciting opportunites of web development after having worked in commercial laboratories for indoor air quality.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Florida and I lived there for 29 years, before moving to California and now Texas.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy going on hikes, cooking meals, playing video games and going out to eat with friends.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Growing up, my dream was to work for the CDC and I did work in commercial microbiology labs for 8 years. Now I would love to be a web developer helping to create things that millions of people will use.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I moved to Austin, TX June 2020 with my girlfriend from Los Angeles where we lived for a year.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The opportunities seem endless when it comes to being a web developer. Signing up for this program, I was asked if I wanted to work for a company, be a freelancer, or start my own business. How many industries allow that kind of flexibility? <br><br>The stability of the being a developer is also something that made me want to work on this, especially after the events of this year. But, mostly, it is my fascination with being able to create things with just a computer and knowledge. You don't need highly technical equipment like in many science fields or huge amounts of capital in financial fields. A person and a computer can do incredible things and I want to be a part of that.</p>
